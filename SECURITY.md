# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest release and the `main` branch receive security fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a security problem.

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting instead. Open the [Security tab](https://github.com/aethera-deeptech/backend/security) and choose **Report a vulnerability**, or go straight to the [advisory form](https://github.com/aethera-deeptech/backend/security/advisories/new). The report stays private. Only you, the people who manage security advisories for this repository, and anyone who is added to the report can see it.

A good report includes the following.

- A description of the problem and its impact, for example data exposure between businesses, a way around sign-in or a leaked secret.
- Steps to reproduce it, or a proof of concept.
- The commit or the address of the deployment you tested.
- Relevant logs with any secrets removed.

The report is triaged, fixed in private when it is valid, and, where it makes sense, released with a published advisory. Reporters who want credit are named once the fix has shipped. This project does not promise a reply time.

## Scope

In scope are the code in this repository and its GitHub Actions workflows.

Out of scope are other people's deployments of this project, findings that need a compromised device or server, and reports that only describe missing hardening without a way to exploit it.

Do not run automated scanning or load testing against a live deployment you do not own.

## How this repository is checked

Findings from the automated tooling in this repository, which is CodeQL, a Go vulnerability check, a license check, dependency review, gitleaks, Trivy, the ZAP baseline and active scans, fuzzing and OSSF Scorecard, are triaged the same way as external reports.

Some Scorecard alerts describe the limits of a repository with one owner, such as a `main` branch that needs no approving review, or a project that is young. Those alerts stay open and are not dismissed. The `main` branch still needs a pull request, a clean set of required checks, resolved review threads and verified signatures before anything is merged.
